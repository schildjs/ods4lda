\usage{
LogLikeiC2(subjectData, beta, sigma0, sigma1, rho, sigmae)
}
\arguments{
\item{subjectData}{a list containing: yi, xi, zi, Weights.i}

\item{beta}{mean model parameter p-vector}

\item{sigma0}{std dev of the random intercept distribution}

\item{sigma1}{std dev of the random slope distribution}

\item{rho}{correlation between the random intercept and slope}

\item{sigmae}{std dev of the measurement error distribution}

\item{w.function}{options include "mean" "intercept" "slope" and "bivar"}

\item{cutpoints}{cutpoints defining the sampling regions. (a vector of length 4 c(xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh))}

\item{SampProb}{Sampling probabilities from within each region (vector of length 2 c(central region, outlying region)).}
}
