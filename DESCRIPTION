Description: Fit linear mixed models under outcome dependent sampling designs.
    As of now it will fit maximum likelihood for random intercept and slope models
    for random sampling designs and ascertainment corrected maximum likelihood for
    ODS designs. [see: Schildcrout, J.S., Rathouz, P.J., Zelnick, L.R., Garbett, S.P., Heagerty, P.J..
